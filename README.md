# Zain Gova - SVGLogoMaker

## Description

This is a simple node.js app that is used for generating custom logos. It prompts the user for a specified shape, logo-text, shape color, and text color and then it outputs a new SVG file matching those specifications.

## Visuals

<video src="assets/media/demo.mp4" controls title="Title"></video>

## Usage

To use this app, npm install the dependancies located in the package.json folder, then run 'node index.js' in your terminal.

Follow the instructions in the terminal by selecting the logo shape, text-content, logo-color, and text-color. For the colors, you have the choice to enter some generic colors as a string or alternatively, any color you would like in hexadecimal format. Then, a new file called logo.svg will be generated containing your logo. Re-running the program will overwrite your old logo.
